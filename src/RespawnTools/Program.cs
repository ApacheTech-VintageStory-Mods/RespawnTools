///     Only one derived instance of this class should be added to any single mod within
///     the VintageMods domain. This class will enable Dependency Injection, and add all
///     of the domain services. Derived instances should only have minimal functionality, 
///     instantiating, and adding Application specific services to the IOC Container.
