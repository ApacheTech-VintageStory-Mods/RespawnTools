  "handbooktext-respawntablet-usage": "If the player is holding a respawn tablet in their main-hand, off-hand, or backpack slot, and receives otherwise fatal damage, the totem saves the player from death. The respawn tablet must be in the player's hand (main hand, or offhand), or within a backpack slot, for it to work. It does not work if it is in the hotbar, unless selected. The tablet can be used only once; it disappears after use.",
